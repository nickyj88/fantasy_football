Don't forget to use your .gitignore file in the home directory of the project so we're not committing extraneous files that may mess with namespaces!


This app aims to do the following:

1. Keep a record of every pick in the draft.
2. Update team rosters as players are selected.
3. Analyze the remaining players pool to recommend a draft pick, as well as offer the probability that a player will be on the board at your next pick.
