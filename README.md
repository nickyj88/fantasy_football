Don't forget to use your .gitignore file in the home directory of the project so we're not committing extraneous files that may mess with namespaces!


This app aims to do the following:

1. Keep a record of every pick in the draft.
2. Update team rosters as players are selected.
3. Analyze the remaining players pool to recommend a draft pick, as well as offer the probability that a player will be on the board at your next pick.


Current status 
  1. Functional record updates based on data entry
  2. Positional filters on available players
  3. All rosters rendered with tab selection; ours in its own section

Next Steps
  1. Build mechanism to increase bye week counts
  2. Pick Tracker
  3. Show count of players at each bye week on team
  4. Build queue feature
  5. Add functionality to enter keepers before the draft and entail all appropriate effects
